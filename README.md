# 🌩 Cloud Resume Challenge

This project is my implementation of the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/).  
It takes a traditional resume and turns it into a fully deployed, cloud-native web application — complete with front end, back end, database, and CI/CD automation.

## ✨ Lessons Learned

- Cloud projects rarely go in a straight line — DNS, SSL, and CDN required patience and debugging.  
- Automating deployments gave me confidence to iterate faster.  
- Documenting progress weekly (blog/README) helped me see growth and explain choices clearly.  

---

## 📌 Next Steps

- Add more automation and monitoring (logging, alerts).  
- Expand the resume site into a small portfolio hub.
