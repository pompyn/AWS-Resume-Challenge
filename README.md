## ✨ Lessons Learned

- Cloud projects rarely go in a straight line — DNS, SSL, and CDN required patience and debugging.  
- Automating deployments gave me confidence to iterate faster.  
- Documenting progress weekly (blog/README) helped me see growth and explain choices clearly.  
- Multi-cloud integration showed me how to connect platforms for resilience and cost awareness.

## 📌 Next Steps

- Add monitoring and alerting across both AWS and Azure.  
- Expand the resume site into a small portfolio hub.  
- Publish a blog post on the **benefits of multi-cloud resilience**.
